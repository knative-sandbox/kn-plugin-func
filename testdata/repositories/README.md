# Test Repositories

Contains examples of previously-installed repositories for use in tests.

## customTemplatesRepo

Contains an example of a repository consisting of simple templates, subgrouped
by runtime.  As the base case, it contains no additional metadata and is
intended to show the simplest possible way to provide custom templates.

## customLanguagePackRepo

Contains an example of a repository that includes a manifest.yaml, defining
an alternate internal location for templates (used when the root needs to
contain other directories, such as those necessary for language pack repos
which also contain templates)
